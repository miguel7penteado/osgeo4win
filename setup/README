This directory contains the source code for the Setup program
for the OSGeo4W net releases.


HOW TO BUILD:
-------------
Setup should build out-of-the-box on any Cygwin environment that has all the
required packages installed:
  - bison
  - flex
  - mingw-gcc-g++
  - make
  - libiconv
  - libbz2-devel
  - mingw-zlib
  - mingw-bzip2
  - and all packages that are dependencies of the above, i.e. gcc-core,
    gcc-mingw-core, mingw-runtime, mingw-binutils, mingw-w32api, etc.  These
    should all be automatically added by setup.

The following additional packages are required if building from SVN, not from
a source tarball, or if you want to make changes to the build system.
  - recent autoconf
  - recent automake
  - recent libtool

Build commands:
1) Skip this step if you are building from a source tarball.
   $ ./bootstrap.sh --enable-mirror=path_to_mirror
    * You should choose a mirror with x32 release from: http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/testing_license
    * If you want to use a mirror with x64 testing version you should choose:  http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/testing64
 
2) $ make

3) Wondering why your binary is so much bigger than the official releases?
   Remove debugging symbols:
   $ strip -s osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe
   Compress using UPX(please install it before):
   $ upx -9 osgeo4w-setup-x86.exe
