This directory contains libmd5-rfc-20020413
Website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmd5-rfc

The libmd5-rfc package consists of the three files:
  - md5.c
  - md5.h
  - md5main.c

This README is specific to Cygwin setup.

The md5main.c file is not used, but is present so that this directory 
corresponds exactly (with the exception of this README) to the upstream
distribution tarball.

There are no local modifications to this code.
